### Scope

 

### Structure 

* In order to meet the expectation of "The Wine Shop" users,  the website aims to stick to convention 
in its layout and architecture.

* There is a header section on each page, with a "The Wine Shop" title in the header. Clicking on this
title will take the user back to the landing page of the website and this is, as mentioned above, 
an expected and understood convention. 

* There is a Log In / Registration Feature which enables users to create an account.

* All elements of the website are easily discoverable and aim to ensure that the user can get to their desired destination within 3 clicks. 

* The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent.

* The website is interactive and provides lots of feedback to the user. 

* The architecture of this website has been carefully considered with the user in mind and allows for ease of movement through the content. 

* Information on this section has been inspired by the information on [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopment)

### Skeleton 

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com)

Please find full PDF versions of wireframes and sketches below:

* [Mobile Wireframe]()
* [Tablet Wireframe]()
* [Desktop Wireframe]()

#### Database Architecture



### Surface 

#### Design 

* The overall design of the website is  simple. The site owner wants the user to simply navigate and 
understand what is on offer without being inundated with information. Clear text and imagery are used to achieve this. 

#### Colour 

* The colour theme used throughout the website is simple and minimalist, the theme was specifically chose to allow 
for the images to stand out and ensure that users can fully appreciate the products for sale. 

* When choosing the colours the [Colour Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) was used to assist.

#### Typography

* Lato was chosen as this is a simple, classy and unfussy font which will be clear and easy to read. 
This was chosen using [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

#### Images 

* The background image used on the website homepage has been carefully chosen to ensure the theme of the website is understood on first glance.
