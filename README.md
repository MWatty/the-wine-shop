### Strategy 

The Wine Shop - is, as the name suggests, a website that sells wine.  

### User Stories 

#### Visitor Goals 

* As a visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the site. 
* As a visitor, I want the site to be simple to navigate.
* As a visitor, I want to quickly find information about wine. 
* As a visitor, I want to register an account so that I can add, update, edit and delete information I have provided.  
* As a visitor, I want the site to be visually appealing.
* As a visitor, I want the site to be accessible and responsive on all devices.

### Scope

 

### Structure 

* In order to meet the expectation of "The Wine Shop" users,  the website aims to stick to convention 
in its layout and architecture.

* There is a header and footer section on each page, with a "The Wine Shop" title in the header. Clicking on this
title will take the user back to the landing page of the website and this is, as mentioned above, 
an expected and understood convention. 

* There is a Log In / Registration Feature which enables users to create an account.

* All elements of the website are easily discoverable and aim to ensure that the user can get to their desired destination within 3 clicks. 

* The colouring, theme and terminology used throughout the website is consistent.

* The website is interactive and provides lots of feedback to the user. 

* The architecture of this website has been carefully considered with the user in mind and allows for ease of movement through the content. 

* Information on this section has been inspired by the information on [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_program/diplomainsoftwaredevelopment)

### Skeleton 

All wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](http://balsamiq.com)

Please find full PDF versions of wireframes and sketches below:

* [Mobile Wireframe]()
* [Tablet Wireframe]()
* [Desktop Wireframe]()

#### Database Architecture



### Surface 

#### Design 

* The overall design of the website is  simple. The site owner wants the user to simply navigate and 
understand what is on offer without being inundated with information. Clear text and imagery are used to achieve this. 

#### Colour 

* 

* When choosing the colours the [Colour Picker Tool](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool) was used to assist.

#### Typography

* Lato was chosen as this is a simple, classy and unfussy font which will be clear and easy to read. 
This was chosen using [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;

#### Images 

* The background image used throughout the website has been carefully chosen to ensure the theme of the website is maintained throughout.

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used to make the use of JavaScript on the website easier. 

### Version Control 

* [GIT](https://git-scm.com/) was used as version control in utilising [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) to add code, commit and push to [GitHub](https://github.com).

* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) was used as this is an open source platform for automated and ready to code development environments that blends into your existing workflow.

* [GitHub](https://github.com) was used as a hosting platform for version control.

### Tools and Other Resources 

* [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) was used to edit pages and diagnose problems quickly. 

* [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com/) was used for cross browser testing.

* [Am I responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is) was used to create a mock up.

* [Web Formatter](https://webformatter.com/html) used to correctly indent files. 

* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com) was used to delpoy the app. 



* [Black](black.vercel.app) was used to format the Python code. 

## Testing 

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project. 

* [WC3 Markup Validation Serivce]

* [W3C CSS Validation Service](

JShint was used to detect errors and potential problems within the JavaScript Code. The only issues identified in JShint as per 
the results below related to the use of 'let' which are is available in ES6, this is not a cause for concern.
